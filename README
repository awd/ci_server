README

This is a Rack Application.
It configures and runs an instance of CI Joe
on a single application repository.

Configure the following files with settings specific to your needs.

config.ru
- update REPO_NAME

deploy/after_restart.rb
- update REPO_NAME
- update BRANCH_NAME

lib/hooks/after-reset
- update SHARED_DB path (ie: /data/APP_NAME_HERE/shared/config/database.yml)
- update CURRENT_DB path (ie: /data/APP_NAME_HERE/current/repos/REPO_NAME_HERE/config/database.yml)

lib/hooks/build-failed
- update path to mailer.rb (ie: /data/APP_NAME_HERE/current/lib/mailer.rb)
- this ruby script emails us the details, however, since build-failed is a shell
  script, you can use normal command line tools as well
  
lib/mailer.rb
- update the Sender and Receiver email addresses
- we use Mad Mimi, but you can replace this with ActionMailer, or any
  other 3rd party emailer
